# Data Mining Project - 2024/2025

**João Condeço - m56970**

## Goal:
To study and apply Data Mining to a dataset and present the results in an article format.

The work should be done alone and submitted through Moodle.

## Important Dates:
- **Decide the type of work and the dataset until 9th of December** (minimum of 500 instances in the dataset). You should submit your proposal and I will give you feedback.
- **Submit a 1st version until 8th of January 2025** so that you may have some feedback on your work (it can be an incomplete version).
- **Final version until 20th of January.**

## Work Structure:

The work should focus on the following aspects and answer the following questions, in the suggested order. This way, you will be prepared to perform the work.

### 1. Present the main approaches already published about the problem you want to work on.

### 2. Present the dataset, explaining why it is relevant.

### 3. Cite some references you consider to be more important from publications with reviews, where the dataset has been used before.

### 4. Define the approach you will follow - classification, clustering, regression, etc. Please present the software tools you will use and justify your choice.

### 5. **If applicable**, consider a cost matrix to evaluate performance, or discuss which will be your goal in terms of the performance index.

### 6. Select which algorithms you will use. 
If you are working on a classification problem, choose at least three different types of algorithms: Rules, Trees, SVMs, ANN, Bayesian, Clustering, Ensemble, etc.  
You should search and cite references that used the same kind of approach to compare, or else state that you have searched and there isn't prior work using the same approach.

### 7. You should not use algorithms in a "blind" way, so you should analyze them carefully.

### 8. After you know the algorithms you will use, start training and testing experiments. Present and compare your results.

### 9. Some issues should be explicitly and carefully presented such as:
- If you applied some attribute selection algorithms, outlier removal, or dealing with missing values.
- How you divided the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets.
- Which performance measure you used to compare results, and what kind of validation (e.g., cross-validation)?
- Did you investigate a learning curve, a ROC curve, or a cost-sensitive classifier?
- What code you developed, if applicable, and where it is accessible (provide a link).
- What is the performance in terms of speed/computational load?

### 10. You should finish the article by pointing out some topics for future work.

## Suggested Structure:
1. **Abstract**: Should be done at the end. Define the main goals and results.
2. **Introduction**: Item 1.
3. **Data**: Items 2 and 3.
4. **Algorithms / Proposed Solutions**: Items 4, 5, 6, 7.
5. **Results**: Items 8 and 9.
6. **Conclusions and Future Work**: Item 10.
